          Welcome to the about me part of this website, here you'll find some
          information about me and my website

        <p class="about_me">
          I've been working in the IT world for 7-8 years ever since I finished
          high school. I was able to gain a very valuable knowledge throughout
          the years in all sorts of technologies, tools etc. At the moment I'm a
          <strong>L3 Backup Delivery Lead</strong> at DXC Technology where my
          time is slowly but surely coming to an end and hence I'm looking
          forward to new things that await me. <br /><br />
          Recently I started my journey on advancement of my career, learnt few
          new technologies like <strong>Docker</strong>,
          <strong>Kubernetes</strong>, <strong>Python</strong> and even some
          Front-End like <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>. This
          might seem like a chaotic choices however in this day and age its
          better to be versatile and have atleast if not more then basic
          knowledge about as much as possible <br /><br />
          Everything that you see here on this website was done from the
          "scratch" by me. Goal is to have a sort of a portfolio website that I
          would be able to use as example of my knowledge
          <br /><br />
          I plan on "upgrading" this website with new knowledge/skills I'll
          gather in the future. Currently as of 26.9.2024 it stands as bare HTML
          and CSS. Next step would be to implement JavaScript to make it
          interactive. All of this will be documented on my GitHub account.
          <br /><br />
