        <p class="about_me">
          Since I was young kid I always had passion for technology, wether it
          was Games, Coding, Technology, Electronics etc. something always lit a
          spark of interest in those things.
          <br /><br />
          I've been working in the IT world for 7-8 years ever since I finished
          high school. I was able to gain a very valuable knowledge throughout
          the years in all sorts of technologies, tools etc.
          <br /><br />
          recently I started my journey on advancement of my career, learnt few
          new technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, Python and even some
          Front-End like HTML and css
          <br /><br />
          Everything that you see here on this website was done from "scratch"
          by me.
